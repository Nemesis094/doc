1. Select ***Help - Profiler***.
![Help – Profiler](https://cdnweb.devolutions.net/docs/docs_en_rdm_mac_clip10470.png)
1. Move the window to the side to display the {{ en.RDM }} main window and refresh the data source by using the refresh button or by using ***File – Refresh***.
{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %}
Holding the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key while performing the refresh will force a full reload of the data source, thereby ignoring the cache.
{% endsnippet %}
